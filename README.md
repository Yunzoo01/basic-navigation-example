This project contains an example of how to create navigation between multiple web pages (HTML files).

Prepared by web development instructor Dougal Mac Gregor as part of his lessons on Web Development.

# Study Notes:

Pay extra attention to how pages (HTML files) are linked to each other based on whether they are at 
the root (such as index.html) or in a directory ( such as pages/about.html) relative to each other.
